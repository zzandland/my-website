# Converting PDFs into PNGs for thumbnails
## Various approaches that I tried until settling to one appraoch
<hr>

I've been working on a task to migrate a static website hosted on *AWS S3* to have a full backend infrastructure so that clients could dynamically change contents. I considered for a few options on how to implement it, but settled to use Firebase. It's an all-in-one solution that covers most of the needs for a web service, including *authentication*, *data persistence layer*, *static file storage*, *lambda functions*, and *domain hosting*. Specifically, I want to share my experience on what I found to be a working solution of:

> 1. uploading a PDF file
> 2. converting and compressing to a PNG image
> 3. update the database row 

#### Why convert PDF to an image file?

Image files can be used as a preview for PDF files. 

There are two ways of approaching this challenge: client-side and server-side. For UX, the ideal option is to let users upload PDF files, then letting the server to handle the rest of the processes. This way users don't have to wait for all of the processes to complete.
